# Omanotch parks Omarchy's bar on the built-in display while the bar shows in
# the notch strip, but Omarchy's notifications still keep a bar's height of
# room above them there: a gap under the strip. On that display they now keep
# only the normal gap; other displays keep their bar's room. This patches
# Omarchy's notification service itself (a cloned plugin runs sandboxed and
# can't show popups); a pacman hook does it again after Omarchy updates.
# Run as root:  omanotch-notifications.sh on|off   (prints "changed" if it did)
