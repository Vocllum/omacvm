# Changelog

What's new in each OmacVM release. The release notes on GitHub say the same
in more words.

## 2.6.0

- OmacVM.app: Omarchy in its own Mac app, without Parallels, UTM or VMware
  Fusion. It brings QEMU (try-omarchy's patched build) and runs it with
  Apple's Hypervisor framework. Download `OmacVM-2.6.0.zip` from the release,
  signed with a Developer ID. See [docs/routes/app.md](docs/routes/app.md).
- `omacvm build --vm-type app`: builds the VM through OmacVM.app with the same
  questions as the other routes. It downloads the app when it is missing
  (after asking), checks the zip against its `.sha256` and that the app is
  signed with OmacVM's Developer ID. `omacvm update` replaces an older app.
- Omanotch is built in: it lives in `src/omanotch` and OmacVM installs it
  from there, on the Mac and in the VM, with no clone of its own repo.
- Proofs between the VM and the Mac, so another program on the Mac can't pose
  as Gestures, the Bridge or Omanotch: Gestures and Omanotch never get the
  Bridge's token; the VM and the helper each prove they know it (HMAC-SHA256
  over fresh nonces and the Mac address). The Bridge gets the token only
  after its own proof checks out.
